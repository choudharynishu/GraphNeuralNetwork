Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting by Jiawei Zhu, Yujiao Song, 
Lin Zhao, and Haifeng Li. 
    * METRLADataset - Normalize features across all devices and time periods
    * METRLADataset2 - Normalize features - each device individually. Scaling 
                        for train and test period done separately.
